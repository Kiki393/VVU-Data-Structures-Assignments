## Singly Linked List Implementation.

i.) Add nodes to the list i.e. {8, 10, 12, 16, 9, 14} 

ii.) Insert 15 to the front of the list

iii.) Insert 25 after node 16

iv.) Delete node 9 using recursive method

v.) Add node 30 after node 10

vi.) Insert node 45 at the end of the linked list

vii.) Delete node 8 using the iterative method

## Doubly Linked List Implementation

Implemented using family tree

## Stack ADT

Simple stack implementation by simulating the history of visited webpages in a web browser

i.) Elements are pushed to the stack

ii.) The stack is displayed and the top element indicated using the peek() method

iii.) Three elements are removed from the stack using the pop() method

iv.) The new stack is displayed and the top element indicated

## Queue ADT

Queue ADT is implemented by solving the Josephus problem

The Josephus Problem (or Josephus permutation) is a theoretical problem which states that:

There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. 

In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the 

executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom. 

i.) An array is provided indicating the number of seats to be counted at index 0 and the total number of seating positions in index 1

ii.) Seating positions are eliminated until there is only one seat left; the safe position

## Tree ADT

Tree ADT is implemented using binary search

In the main method, elements are added to the tree and a key specified to serch for. 

If the key is found in the tree, a message displays saying the key has been found. The negative is said if not found.
